# Current understanding

NSW has a distinction between tram lanes and tramways. Cyclists are allowed in tram lanes (under rule 158) but not tramways.

Tramways are designated by a `Tram only` sign which is are the signs used for George Street (in some parts - see https://opentrafficsignmap.jakecoppinger.com/). This indicates these sections of George St are off limits for cyclists (unless dismounted).

Hay St West of Sussex St has a single line deliniation which means it is legal to cycle one, but however has a "No Entry" sign at the western entrance. It is unclear whether this "No Entry" sign applies as bicycles can access the light rail corridor from the side of thr track using the traffic lights (with bicycle lantern) at Darling Drive.

Shared paths only end at an end shared path sign (or road crossing) and dont require a blue line, meaning the shared paths leading to Darling Park 'flood fill' all footpaths down to Hay St (up to the zebra crossing at Harbour St).
(this also has the effect of several footparhs in CoS being legal for bicycles due to no end shared path sign present.)

## Clarifications I need
- Does the no entry sign at the western entrance of Hay St (Darling Drive) override the single white line marking Hay St as a tram lane?
  - Or does the entrance to the side of the tramway allow entrance to bicycles but not to cars?
  - See photo at https://www.mapillary.com/app/user/jakecopp?lat=-33.879155786110026&lng=151.20119415593&z=17&pKey=367605089115455&focus=photo
- Does the designated cycle route sign at Hay St & Pitt St have any legal sway over the no entry sign?
  - Photo at https://www.mapillary.com/app/user/jakecopp?lat=-33.880172222222015&lng=151.20716666667&z=16.92996708234354&pKey=670124078124416&focus=photo&x=0.510488795519389&y=0.4588200156144901&zoom=0
- Do light rail platforms count as a "a structure (for example, **a dividing strip, pedestrian refuge, traffic island, row of bollards or separation kerb**), whether or not the structure is also being used to indicate a safety zone" which designates the way as a tram _way_
  - If so, bicycles are not allowed to cycle through light rail stations even if the rest of the street is a tram _lane_
- There isn't any no entry signs at York & George St (northbound) Does this mean it is legal to cycle along George St from York to Barrack St/Martin Place as there isn't a double line marked or any structure next to the track?
  - ...or through to Hunter St/Market St/Grosvenor St if platforms are legal to cycle past depending on above question
  - I note there are some no Left/Right turns for the adjacent road marked, but if a bicycle isn't coming from this road these can't apply
- There isn't a no entry sign at Market St & George St (northbound), however there is a no entry sign at King St & George St (southbound). Does this mean it is only legal to cycle northbound between Market & King St along Geoge St?
  - The same situation from Druitt to Market St, though with the QVB platforms in between (pending on platform question above)
- Are no entry signs specific to the side of the road they are on? Eg. if there is a no entry sign on the left side, can I cycle on the right side of a street?
  - Eg. There isn't a no entry sign on the right side when entering George St at Grosvenor St
- Do shared paths end at a light rail crossing like they do at a road crossing? There is no shared path marking on Quay St south of Hay St (just north of the carpark entrance) though it's heavily used.

# Discussions with police
- Discussed with 2 male police on bikes Thu 1st at 9:20 at the corner of Hay St & Tumbalong Bvd
- They were of opinion cycling is legal along all of Hay Sy light rail track _and_ George St as long
  as cyclists stayed between the rails and did not slow down a tram

- Discussed with police on the ground Friday 4th June 2021 (2 years ago) (see record at https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/105807360).
  Following quotes are conversation with another OpenStreetMap contributor above:
  > Had a chat to cop on the ground, bicycles are currently allowed where no curb between track & street (north of Town Hall). 
  > The cop said bicycles are allowed when no curb between light rail track and the "pedestrian street". North of Druitt St there is no barrier so I believe it is legal. I definitely find it confusing.
  - This broadly aligns with the NSW road rules indicating areas are tram lanes (not tramways) when there is no divider
- Discussed with police Dec 2023. They were of the opinion that cycling along Hay St from Pitt St (westwards) is not legal due to the no entry sign despite the designated bike route signage, and cycling anyone along Geoge St is not legal.

	- The change to motorists' habits has led the council to propose keeping closed several traffic lanes, which were originally to be reopened when the light rail line was completed.
	- They include a southbound lane of George Street from Bathurst to Campbell streets; the intersection of George and Dalley streets; and an eastbound lane of Devonshire Street from Chalmers to Elizabeth streets in Surry Hills.
